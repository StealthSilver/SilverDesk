# Memories of Olly

The sun was set,  
The sand was wet.  

We walked along,  
The waves were long.  

The jokes were silly,  
But we were happy.  

Both our moods were jolly,  
Her name was Olly.  

I still recall her smile,  
Her lovely dressing style.  

My life feels less fun,  
Since her story is done.  

Now I walk alone,  
With a broken heart,  
And a broken phone.
