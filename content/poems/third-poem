# The Story of Her

Every time I saw her,  
I saw her fine.  
My fantasies came true,  
Because she was mine.  

Every time she cried,  
I tried and tried and tried.  
But she only loved beef,  
It was her weird belief.  

Every time she was happy,  
I showed her my score of Flappy.  
We were never against each other,  
The one against us was her mother.  

She arranged her marriage,  
I also got the card.  
The day of her wedding came,  
But I continued eating my soup of lard.
