# Ode to the Hibiscus Tree

Beneath the sun’s warm, golden glow,  
The hibiscus sways, gentle and slow.  
Its petals flare in crimson bright,  
A fleeting blaze of morning light.

The breeze whispers through its leafy green,  
A softer world, a calmer scene.  
Each blossom opens, bold yet shy,  
A fleeting smile beneath the sky.

In gardens still or wild and free,  
The hibiscus stands for all to see.  
A promise of summer, warm and sweet,  
A tender heart in bloom complete.

Though morning fades and petals fall,  
Its fleeting beauty enchants us all.  
A symbol of grace, both fierce and mild,  
Nature’s art, delicate and wild.
