# Summary of _Men Without Women_ by Haruki Murakami

_Men Without Women_ is a 2014 short story collection by Haruki Murakami, translated into English in 2017. The book comprises seven stories that explore the emotional landscapes of men who, in various ways, find themselves alone. These narratives delve into themes of isolation, longing, and the complexities of human relationships.

The stories include:

- **"Drive My Car"**: A widowed actor hires a female chauffeur, leading to unexpected revelations about his late wife and his own emotions.

- **"Yesterday"**: A tale of unspoken love and the complexities of friendship, set against the backdrop of Tokyo's vibrant youth culture.

- **"An Independent Organ"**: A successful doctor falls in love with a married woman, leading to a profound personal crisis.

- **"Scheherazade"**: A man confined to his apartment by illness is visited by a nurse who tells him stories, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy.

- **"Kino"**: After a personal tragedy, a man opens a bar, encountering mysterious events that challenge his understanding of reality.

- **"Samsa in Love"**: A reimagining of Kafka's classic, where Gregor Samsa wakes up as a human and navigates the complexities of love and identity.

- **"Men Without Women"**: The title story, where a man learns of the suicide of his former lover, leading him to reflect on his past and the nature of his feelings.

Through these stories, Murakami examines the nuances of male solitude and the intricate ways in which men cope with the absence of women in their lives. The collection is marked by Murakami's signature blend of surrealism, melancholy, and introspection.
