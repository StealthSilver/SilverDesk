# Summary of _White Nights_ by Fyodor Dostoevsky

_White Nights_ is a short story by Fyodor Dostoevsky, first published in 1848. The narrative unfolds over four nights in St. Petersburg, told from the perspective of an unnamed narrator who is a solitary dreamer. He spends his nights wandering the city's streets, observing life from the periphery.

One evening, he encounters a young woman named Nastenka, who is standing by a canal, crying. The narrator approaches her, and they begin to converse. Nastenka reveals that she is waiting for her lover, who has been away for a long time. Over the course of their conversations, the narrator shares his own feelings of loneliness and longing.

As the nights pass, the bond between the narrator and Nastenka deepens. He falls in love with her, but she remains devoted to her absent lover. Eventually, Nastenka's lover returns, and she reunites with him, leaving the narrator heartbroken yet grateful for the brief connection they shared.

_White Nights_ delves into themes of unrequited love, the yearning for connection, and the bittersweet nature of fleeting relationships. Dostoevsky's portrayal of the narrator's inner turmoil and emotional vulnerability offers a profound exploration of the human condition.
